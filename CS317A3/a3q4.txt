Questions to answer
Apply your implementation to the examples in the given data le LatinSquares.txt, using a time-limit of
10 seconds for each problem in this le. Then apply your implementation to the examples in the given data
le harder_examples.txt, using a time-limit of 200 seconds for each problem in this le.
Answer the following questions and submit them:

1. How many of the problems did your implementation solve within the time limit? How does this compare
to the previous implementation (A3Q3)?
    71947 problems where solved. This is close to but still faster than A3Q3.
        Going problem by problem, in the LatinSquares.txt my implementation was able to solve them all.
        It took 9.029114007949829 seconds to solve all the problems in LatinSquares.txt
