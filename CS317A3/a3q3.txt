Questions to answer
Apply your implementation to the examples in the given data le LatinSquares.txt. Use a time-limit of 10
seconds for each problem.
Answer the following questions and submit them:

1. Howmany of the problems did your implementation solve within 10 seconds? Howdoes this compare
to the previous implementation (A3Q2)?
    60211 problems where solved. This is faster than A3Q2.
    Going problem by problem, in the LatinSquares.txt my implementation was able to solve them all.


2. Consider the largest N that your implementation as able to solve. Do a rough, back-of-the-envelope
calculation to predict how much time it would take to solve the next largest problem in the file, and
the very largest problem in the file. Submit your rough calculations, and your predictions.
    To solve the next largest in the problem it would take O((N-1)^3) time since there at N options for each cell and there are N^2 cells and we are trying to solve the next largest problem.
    To solve the very largest problem in the file it would take at most O(N^3) time since there at N options for each cell and there are N^2 cells.
    From my implementation:
        The average for all the 3x3 examples is 0.04373764991760254 seconds.
        The average for all the 4x4 examples is 0.04515401522318522 seconds.
        So it takes 103.23832055048905 percent more time to calculate the next largest problem.
